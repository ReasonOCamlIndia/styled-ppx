# Interpolation

Interpolation here means using any identifier as a value inside a CSS definition. Useful for reusing variables, handling themes or change styles during run-time.

```rescript
module Component = %styled.div(`
  border: 1px solid $(Theme.black);
)
```

Interpolation only works inside values, which is slightly different from other JavaScript-based solutions (such as styled-components or emotion), where their interpolation is much more dynamic and can be used everywhere. You might find styled-ppx more strict, here's an example:

`margin-${whatever}: 10px` is valid in JavaScript, while isn't valid in styled-ppx. As explained above, this interpolation affects on **properties**, not on **values**.

As a solution, you can implement similar behaviour with more explicitness, handling all properties, using the `css` extension which is described below.

```rescript
let margin = direction =>
  switch direction {
  | #Left => %css("margin-left: 10px;")
  | #Right => %css("margin-right: 10px;")
  | #Top => %css("margin-top: 10px;")
  | #Bottom => %css("margin-bottom: 10px;")
  }
```

styled-ppx forces you to be more rigit, the same way as ReScript does.

<Callout>
Some interpolation is treated as unsafe, disables the type-checker which can lead to run-time issues.
This is the current implementation and the reason for that is because is very hard to implement type-safety with [shorthand properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) with the polymorphism of CSS.

### Polymorphism of CSS

There are plenty of properties on CSS that accept different types of values, the ones encountered more challenging are `animation`, `box-shadow`, `background`, `transition` and `transform`, to name a few.

```css
background: #fff; /* The background is white */
background: url(img.png); /* The background is an image */
background: #fff url(img.png); /* The background is white with an image */
background: url(img.png) no-repeat; /* The background is a non-repeating image */
```

In this case, to interpolate the background's value like: `background: $(variable)` the type-checker can't know the type of `$(variable)` ahead of time, since there's many definitions of `background` valid. This is called **[Overload functions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/by-example.html#overloaded-functions)** and it's not available in ReScript to it's nature of a static typed language.
