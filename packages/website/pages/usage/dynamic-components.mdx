# Dynamic components

Dynamic components mean components that generate styles based on their props. Similar to the concept of React's view as a function of its state, here the styles are a function of its props.

```rescript
module Dynamic = %styled.div(
  (~color, ~background) => j`
    color: $(color);
    background-color: $(background);
  `
)

<Dynamic color="#EB5757" background="#516CF0">
  {React.string("Hello!")}
</Dynamic>
```

Useful to define a React component with their API exposed as props.
Here are applied the same rules as [Interpolation](./interpolation.md).
