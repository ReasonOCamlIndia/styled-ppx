### Dynamic component

Dynamic components mean generate CSS based on props. Similar to the concept of React's view as a function of its state, here the styles are a function of its props.

```reason
module Dynamic = [%styled.div (~color, ~background) => {j|
  color: $(color);
  background-color: $(background);
|j}];

<Dynamic color="#EB5757" background="#516CF0">
  {React.string("Hello!")}
</Dynamic>
```

Useful to define a React component with their API exposed as props that only affect their styles.
Here are applied the same rules as [Interpolation](./interpolation.md), so unsafety is expected.
