# Motivation

I love CSS. In my opinion writing React with styled-components It's one of the best combos for writing scalable design systems, UI libraries and applications. When I discovered Reason back in the days, it wasn't possible to bind to styled-components. Even people were asking for it ([a](https://reasonml.chat/t/idiomatic-way-to-bind-to-styled-components/886) [f](https://reasonml.chat/t/styled-components-possible/554)[e](https://reasonml.chat/t/styling-solutions-reasonreact-as-of-aug-18/958)[w](https://reasonml.chat/t/options-and-best-practices-for-styling-in-reasonreact/261) [t](https://twitter.com/lyovson/status/1233397294311100417)[i](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)[m](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)[e](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)[s](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)).

Using CSS instead of a tiny abstraction enables integrations

Mostly since styled-components/emotion relied on a JavaScript feature that isn't available in Reason (template literals).

Aside from all of this, there were a few efforts on bringing type-safety on top of CSS with [bs-css]() or [bs-glamour](). Even thought I liked that approach, it had two big drawbacks. The need for learning a new DSL on top of CSS was tedious and the runtime is huge.

After discovering what a ppx was (*"a mechanism to embed other languages inside Reason"*) It was possible to mimic the same API as styled components. That's where this project became a reality.

To know more about how it works or what are the benefits I recommend to watch [my talk at ReasonSTHLM Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekHCBZiCviM).

### Credits

- [**Javier Ch√°varri**](https://github.com/jchavarri): for the introduction to Reason. Teaching me all his knowledge about OCaml, AST, ppx rewritters and the help of boostrapping the project.
- [**Alessandro Strada**](https://github.com/astrada): this project started with inspiration from [bs-css-ppx](https://github.com/astrada/ppx_bs_css)
- [**Eduardo Rafael**](https://github.com/EduardoRFS/): to teach me how to write a compiler and a type-checker. His initial implementation of the CSS Value definition and the parser combinator.
- [**Rizo**](https://github.com/rizo): for the help with the API design, discussions and great conversations about styling and CSS.
- [**Max Lantas**](https://github.com/mnxn): for implementing the VSCode extension.
- This project builds on a long line of earlier work by clever folks in the JavaScript community from around the world. People from [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), [emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion), [compiledcssinjs](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled), [linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria), and many more.
