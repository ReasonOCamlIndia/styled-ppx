### Typed styled components in Reason, OCaml and ReScript

Write your styles in CSS inside Reason/OCaml/ReScript files and generate components, classnames or composable CSS rules.

- Component-based
- Type-safe static CSS
- No abstraction over standard CSS, neither a new [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
- Build on top of [emotion](https://emotion.sh)
- Support entirely the language: pattern-matching, composition, labelled arguments.

**styled-ppx** is a ppx you can learn more in the [Real World OCaml: Preprocessing with ppx](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/ppx.html). For now, are similar to [babel-plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins/) which transform your code.

```reason
module Center = [%styled.div {|
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
|}];

<Center>
  {React.string("Hello from the future!")}
</Center>
```
