### Typed styled components for ReScript

**styled-ppx** is the [ppx](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/ppx.html) that brings typed styled components to ReScript. Allows you to create **React Components** with type-safe style definitions that don't rely on a different language than CSS.

Build on top of [emotion](https://emotion.sh), it allows you to style apps safe, quickly, performant and as you always done it.

```rescript
module Center = %styled.div(`
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
`)

<Center>
  {React.string("Hello from the future!")}
</Center>
```

- Type-safe CSS
- Component-based styling
- Implements utility helpers such as classname and css
- There's no abstraction over standard CSS, neither a new language or [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
- Support the power of the underliying language: pattern-matching, composition, labelled arguments
- Build on top of [emotion](https://emotion.sh)

**styled-ppx** is a ppx, can learn more about ppxs in the [Real World OCaml: Preprocessing with ppx](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/ppx.html). To get a general idea, are similar to [babel-plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins/). They run before the compilation of your code, and expands those notations (`%styled.div{:rescript}` or `%cx{:rescript}`) into valid ReScript code.
