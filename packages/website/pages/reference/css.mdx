# CSS Rule: `css` extension

Generates a `Css.Rule` (from [bs-css](https://github.com/giraud/bs-css)) given a single CSS rule. The `%css` extension is useful with combination with the [Array API](./array.md), to compose and re-use rules.

## Example

```rescript
let rule: Css.Rule.t = %css("display: block")
```

## Features

- CSS Declarations aren't allowed. Declarations can contain selectors, rules only a pair of property/value. If you need a selector or more than one rule, use `%cx` instead.
- Semi-colon is optional. `display: block;` and `display: block` are the same.
- Curly braces aren't allowed. `{ display: block }` isn't valid.
