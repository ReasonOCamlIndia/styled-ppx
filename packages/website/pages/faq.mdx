# Frequently asked questions

## Does it support Reason or OCaml syntaxes?
Yes, both. Code snippets are written in ReScript for simplicity. However, you can use Reason and OCaml syntaxes. Since its meant to be used in a browser, **styled-ppx** follows the same restrictions as ReScript.

As well, our VSCode extension supports ReScript, Reason and OCaml syntaxes.

The differences are around syntaxes are the string delimiters:
Reason and OCaml uses `"` or `{||}` while ReScript uses "\`". The recommendation is to use `{||}` when it's a multi-line
