# Workaround for unsupported properties

There's no way to add unsafe behaviour on CSS definitions. Prefer to keep improving the overall safety via requests/issues than allowing a method for unsafe to all.

If this is bottle-neck, there's a handy way to workaround. The solution is to use the Array API to generate `%cx` calls, like this example:

```rescript
let block: Css.Rule.t = %css("display: block")
let randomProperty = CssJs.unsafe("aspect-ratio", "21 / 9");
let picture = %cx([block, randomProperty]);
```

Here the lack of safety will rely on your usage of `CssJs.unsafe`.
