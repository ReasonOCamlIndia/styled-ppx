# Introduction

<Features />

**styled-ppx** is the [ppx](https://victor.darvariu.me/jekyll/update/2018/06/19/ppx-tutorial.html) that enables *CSS-in-Reason*.
Build on top of [emotion](https://emotion.sh), it allows you to style apps quickly, performant and as you always done it.
Allows you to create **React Components** with Type-safe CSS style definitions that don't rely on a specific [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) and great error messages:

## Overview

**`styled-ppx`** implements a ppx that transforms `[%styled]` extensions points into `[@react.components]` modules with [bs-emotion](https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-emotion) as styles, which does all the CSS-in-JS under the hood thanks to [emotion](https://emotion.sh).

This is how you can write components in ReasonML or OCaml with this ppx:

### Standard styled component
```reason
module StyledComponent = [%styled.div {|
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
  height: 100vh;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100vw;
|}];

ReactDOMRe.renderToElementWithId(
  <StyledComponent> {React.string("Hello from the future!")} </StyledComponent>,
  "app",
);
```
