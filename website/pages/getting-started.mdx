# Getting Started

## Installation

This package depends on [bs-emotion](https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-emotion), [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/) and [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io), make sure you follow their installations.

### With `esy` on native projects

```bash
esy add davesnx/styled-ppx
```

### With `npm` or `yarn` on BuckleScript projects

```bash
yarn add @davesnx/styled-ppx @ahrefs/bs-emotion
# Or
npm install @davesnx/styled-ppx @ahrefs/bs-emotion
```

And add the PPX in your `bsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "bs-dependencies": [
    "reason-react",
    "@ahrefs/bs-emotion"
  ],
  "ppx-flags": ["@davesnx/styled-ppx/styled-ppx"]
}
```

However, if you want to use `esy` in BuckleScript:
Create an `esy.json` file with the content:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "styled-ppx": "*",
    "ocaml": "~4.6.1000"
  },
  "resolutions": {
    "styled-ppx": "davesnx/styled-ppx"
  }
}
```

And add the PPX in your `bsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "ppx-flags": ["esy x styled-ppx.exe"]
}
```

If you want to try out of the box a project, just visit https://github.com/davesnx/try-styled-ppx and follow the instalation process there.

## Editor Support

One of the fears of using a ppx is editor support, we belive that having compiling errors and syntax highlight would be an amazing experience. Install the VSCode extension:

**[VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davesnx.vscode-styled-ppx)**

- If you are interested on another editor, please fill an issue and we would consider.
