Thanks to [Javier Ch√°varri](https://github.com/jchavarri), for helping me understand all the world of OCaml and his knowledge about ppx's. It has been a great experience.
Inspired by [@astrada](https://github.com/astrada/) `bs-css-ppx` and his [CSS Parser](https://github.com/astrada/ocaml-css-parser).
Thanks to [ahrefs/bs-emotion](https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-emotion) and [emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion).
